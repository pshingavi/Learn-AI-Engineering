    "1. Yes. OpenAI’s Embeddings API allows you to specify a lower-dimensional embedding using the optional dimensions parameter at inference time. The model’s default embedding size is 1536. You can request a smaller vector (e.g., 512, 256, etc.). The model itself is not retrained — the output is truncated in a principled way\n",

    "{\n",

    "  \"input\": \"Your text here\",\n",
    "  \"dimensions\": 512\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "> This capability is supported by the v3 embedding models, as documented in the OpenAI API reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. OpenAI uses Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). The embedding model is trained so that prefixes of the full embedding vector are independently meaningful A 1536-dim embedding contains nested representations:\n",
    "- First 256 dims → useful embedding\n",
    "- First 512 dims → better embedding\n",
    "- First 1024 dims → even better\n",
    "- Full 1536 dims → best quality\n",

These exercises can provide relief:\\n- Neck Rolls: Slowly roll your head in a circle, 5 times in each direction.\\n- Shoulder Shrugs: Raise shoulders toward ears, hold for 5 seconds, then release. Repeat 10 times.\\n- Chest Opener: Clasp hands behind back, squeeze shoulder blades together, and lift arms slightly. Hold for 15-30 seconds.\\n- Chin Tucks: While sitting or standing tall, pull your chin back to create a \"double chin.\" Hold for 5 seconds, repeat 10 times.\\n\\nChapter 3: Building a Workout Routine\\n\\nStarting a new exercise routine can feel overwhelming. The key is to start slowly and gradually increase intensity and duration over time.\\n\\nBe',\n",

    "Before we do that, let's stop and think a bit about how OpenAI's chat models work.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know they have roles - as is indicated in the following API [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat/create-messages)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three roles, and they function as follows (taken directly from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api)):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
    "2. Then, you can provide a few examples in the form of \"assistant\"/\"user\" pairs\n",
    "3. Then, you prompt the model with the true \"user\" message.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll be forgoing the 2nd step for simplicity's sake."

    "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "- Use the seed parameter: Include the seed parameter in your API call and set it to any arbitrary integer (e.g., 42). Using the same seed value for repeated requests is the primary mechanism for the system to make a \"best effort\" to sample deterministically.\n",
    "- Set temperature to 0: The temperature parameter controls the randomness of the output. A value of 0 (or a minuscule value close to zero, like 0.0000000000000000000001 for older models/APIs where 0 might be handled differently) will make the model's token selection more deterministic, always picking the highest probability token.\n",
    "- Keep all other parameters constant: Every other parameter in your request (including top_p, max_tokens, prompt wording, system messages, etc.) must be exactly the same for you to get the same output.\n",
    "- Pin the model version: Language models are updated by OpenAI periodically, which can impact reproducibility even with the same parameters. Use a specific model version (e.g., gpt-4o-2024-08-06 rather than gpt-4o) to ensure the exact same model weights and infrastructure are used. \n",
    "- Monitoring Reproducibility\n",
    "    - Check the system_fingerprint: The API response includes a system_fingerprint field, which is an identifier for the current combination of model weights and backend configuration used by the servers. If this fingerprint changes between requests, even with the same seed, it indicates that an update on the backend may affect the consistency of the output. \n",
    "- Limitations\n",
    "    - Determinism is not guaranteed: Even with all the above measures, OpenAI notes that perfect determinism is not guaranteed due to the inherent complexities and non-deterministic nature of modern computing and large language models.\n",
    "    - Longer outputs increase variability: Requests with larger max_tokens values tend to be less deterministic. "

    "Manhattan has the largest absolute values because it sums differences across all 1536 dimensions.\n",

    "4. Retrieval Quality is Excellent\n",
    "- All queries retrieved highly relevant chunks as the top result, demonstrating that the RAG system works well regardless of which distance metric is used.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Practical Implications\n",
    "- For OpenAI embeddings: Cosine similarity and dot product are interchangeable - use whichever is computationally convenient\n",
    "- Dot product is fastest: No normalization step needed at query time\n",
    "- When metrics might differ: With non-normalized embeddings (some open-source models), you'd see ranking differences between cosine (angle-based) and Euclidean (magnitude-sensitive)\n",
    "- Manhattan distance: Useful for sparse vectors or when you want to penalize outlier dimensions less severely than Euclidean"

You know, it's just the presence and absence of light, which gives the black colour its colour, you know. So what people need to understand is that this is a very wide spectrum and just labelling something as good and bad does more harm to you than benefits. Right. So first of all, get rid of the notion that something is healthy or unhealthy. If you have established this before. And I think the world scientists, you know, they've hinted at this thing over and over again, that it's really the dosage that makes the poison. Right. Which means that even the healthiest of the foods on the planet will become unhealthy when the quantity exceeds your ADI in a similar manner. Even the worst kinds of foods on planet which people deem as unfit, might just be beneficial in smaller quantities or micro quantities.

Talking about the perfect diet, I think going back to the 50's or 60's, there have been these cycles of, you know, good food versus bad food that's been coming at us. In the 50's and 60's we were told, Oh my God, fats are terrible. Start eating more carbs. In the 70s and 80s suddenly carbs became the villain. Everybody is doing keto. So like you said, everyone is searching for that one perfect thing that is going to help them. How is that damaging to people, Tell us that. So the reason why we go from one thing to another is primarily because we believe that everything is a black or white. It has to be either this or that, it doesn't really work that way you know, there's like millions of colours. The spectrum is way too wide.
