    "\n",

    "- Takes an input\n",
    "- Performs some operation\n",
    "- Returns an output\n",
    "\n",
    "Every component in LangChain (models, prompts, retrievers, parsers) is a Runnable, which means they all share the same interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = runnable.invoke(input)           # Single input\n",
    "results = runnable.batch([input1, input2]) # Multiple inputs\n",
    "for chunk in runnable.stream(input):       # Streaming\n",
    "    print(chunk)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is LCEL (LangChain Expression Language)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**LCEL** allows you to chain Runnables together using the `|` (pipe) operator:\n",

    "result = chain.invoke({\"query\": \"Hello!\"})\n",

    "## ❓ Question #2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the `calculate` and `get_current_time` tools we created, why is the **docstring** so important for each tool? How does the agent use this information when deciding which tool to call?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "The docstring is the tool’s “sales pitch” to the LLM. It’s how the model understands what the tool does, when it should be used, and what inputs it expects.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you decorate a function with @tool, LangChain extracts metadata from it and sends that to the LLM as part of the tool schema. Behind the scenes, each tool becomes something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "{\n",

    "  \"description\": \"Evaluate a mathematical expression. Use this for any math calculations.\",\n",

    "      }\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    \"required\": [\"expression\"]\n",
    "  }\n",
    "} \n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM never sees your Python code.\n",
    "It only sees:\n",
    "- the tool name\n",
    "- the docstring-derived description\n",
    "- the argument descriptions\n",
    "So the docstring is effectively the API documentation for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "> How the agent uses the docstring to choose a tool\n",
    "\n",
    "In LangChain v1.0, the decision flow looks like this:\n",
    "- User asks a question\n",
    "- The LLM is prompted with:\n",
    "    - system instructions\n",
    "    - conversation history\n",
    "    - all tool descriptions (docstrings)\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM performs a semantic match:\n",
    "“Does any tool description look useful for answering this?”\n",

    "\n",
    "How does **Agentic RAG** differ from traditional RAG? What are the advantages and potential disadvantages of letting the agent decide when to retrieve information?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "In Agentic RAG, retrieval is treated as a tool that the agent can invoke only when needed.\n",
    "User query → Model reasons →\n",
    "    ├─ Call retriever tool (if needed)\n",
    "    └─ Answer directly (if not needed)\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent:\n",
    "- Reasons about whether it already knows the answer\n",
    "- Decides when to retrieve and what to retrieve\n",
    "- Can retrieve multiple times or not at all\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Advantages of Agentic RAG\n",
    "1. Efficiency\n",
    "- Avoids unnecessary retrieval calls\n",
    "- Reduces latency and cost\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Better reasoning\n",
    "- Retrieval can happen mid-reasoning\n",
    "- The agent can refine queries based on prior tool results\n",
    "\n",
    "3. More natural behavior\n",
    "- Mimics how humans think (“Do I need to look this up?”)\n",
    "- Enables multi-step research and synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Flexible workflows\n",
    "- Retrieval can be combined with other tools (calculators, APIs, databases)\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ Potential Disadvantages\n",
    "1. Higher complexity\n",
    "- Harder to debug than a fixed pipeline\n",
    "- More moving parts (loops, tool calls, middleware)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Non-determinism\n",
    "- The agent may choose not to retrieve when it should\n",
    "- Behavior can vary across model versions or prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Risk of hallucination\n",
    "- If the agent thinks it knows the answer but doesn’t\n",
    "- Requires good prompting and guardrails\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Loop risks\n",
    "- Poor tool descriptions or prompts can cause over-retrieval or infinite loops"

    "> Imagine a production AI agent handling:\n",
    "- customer queries\n",
    "- internal knowledge retrieval\n",
    "- API calls (tickets, refunds, billing systems)\n",
    "In this environment, middleware is essential for safety, observability, and cost control.\n",
    "\n",

    "Use case: \n",
    "- Audit and debugging\n",
    "- Compliance (PII / prompt tracking)\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it’s needed:\n",
    "- Logs the exact prompt being sent to the model\n",
    "- Helps diagnose hallucinations or unexpected behavior\n",
    "- Enables traceability for regulated environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Example benefit:\n",

    "Use case:\n",
    "- Tool-usage analysis\n",

    "\n",
    "Why it’s needed:\n",
    "- Captures whether the model:\n",

    "- Enforces a hard upper bound on model calls per request\n",
    "- Protects infrastructure from infinite reasoning cycles\n",
    "\n",

    "If an agent keeps looping between “search → think → search”, the middleware stops it safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Which one would I use and why ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally I would use all of the above and additionally Human in the loop too. Middleware allows you to:\n",
    "- Observe the agent without changing core logic\n",
    "- Enforce policies centrally\n",
    "- Add guardrails without modifying prompts or tools\n",
    "- It transforms agents from experiments into operational systems"

      "Here are evidence-based tips to improve your sleep:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Keep a consistent schedule: Go to bed and wake up at the same times every day, including weekends. This helps regulate your body clock [Source 1, Source 3].\n",
      "- Build a relaxing wind‑down routine: Try reading, gentle stretching, a warm bath, meditation, deep breathing, or progressive muscle relaxation in the hour before bed to signal your brain it’s time to sleep [Source 1, Source 2].\n",
      "- Optimize your sleep environment: Keep your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet; many people sleep best around 65–68°F. Use blackout curtains or a sleep mask, and make sure your mattress and pillows are comfortable [Source 1, Source 3].\n",
      "- Limit screens before bed: Avoid phones, tablets, and computers 1–2 hours before bedtime to reduce blue light and mental stimulation [Source 1, Source 3].\n",
      "- Watch caffeine timing: Avoid caffeine after about 2 PM so it doesn’t interfere with falling asleep [Source 1, Source 3].\n",
      "- Exercise regularly (but not too late): Physical activity supports better sleep, but try to finish vigorous workouts several hours before bedtime [Source 1].\n",
      "- Go easy on evening alcohol: Alcohol can disrupt sleep quality later in the night, so keep it limited, especially close to bedtime [Source 1].\n",
      "- Try CBT‑I strategies if you struggle with insomnia: Techniques like progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, and deep breathing can help calm a busy mind. Some people also use herbal teas (chamomile, valerian) or magnesium—check with your healthcare provider before starting supplements [Source 2].\n",
      "\n",
      "Quick checklist to review:\n",
      "- Cool room (around 65–68°F), dark, and quiet\n",
      "- No screens in the last hour\n",
      "- No caffeine after 2 PM\n",
      "- Consistent sleep/wake times\n",
      "- Relaxing pre‑bed routine\n",
      "- Comfortable mattress and pillows [Source 3]\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’d like, tell me what’s hardest for you right now (falling asleep, staying asleep, waking too early), your typical sleep/wake times, and your evening caffeine/screen habits—I can help you tailor a plan.\n",

      "Daily habits\n",
      "- Keep a consistent sleep and wake time, even on weekends [Source 2][Source 3].\n",
      "- Create a relaxing wind-down routine (reading, gentle stretching, or a warm bath) before bed [Source 2].\n",
      "- Exercise regularly, but avoid intense workouts close to bedtime [Source 1][Source 2].\n",
      "- Avoid caffeine after 2 PM [Source 1][Source 2][Source 3].\n",
      "- Limit alcohol and heavy meals before bed [Source 1][Source 2].\n",
      "- Reduce screen exposure 1–2 hours before bedtime [Source 2][Source 3].\n",

      "Sleep environment\n",
      "- Keep your bedroom cool: about 65–68°F (18–20°C) [Source 1][Source 3].\n",
      "- Make it dark: blackout curtains or a sleep mask can help [Source 1][Source 3].\n",
      "- Keep it quiet: consider white noise or earplugs [Source 1].\n",
      "- Prioritize comfort with a supportive mattress and pillows [Source 1][Source 3].\n",

      "- Cut off caffeine after lunch and keep dinner lighter in the evening [Source 1][Source 2].\n",
      "- Keep your room cool, dark, and quiet each night [Source 1][Source 3].\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’d like, tell me:\n",
